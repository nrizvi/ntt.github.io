# ntt.github.io
Official repository for Non-Traditional Techies (NTT) Website

All are welcome to contribute. 

## Design Goals:
This website will be used to (i) recruit potential members, (ii) highlight the accomplishments of our current members and other NTTs, (iii) help potential recruiters and sponsors learn more about us. We will be launching our interview series, posting job opportunities, and other forms of media as our organization grows.

The following is a general guideline to help developers and designers launch our website.

### Include this information:
  * Full name of our organization (Non-Traditional Techies)
  * When we were founded (November 2018)
  * Amount of members (currently 850+)
  * Names of our e-board members, community leaders, developers, and designers
  * Our purpose (To connect those who identify as being non-traditional with professional and educational opportunities)
  * Our mission (To make underrepresented minorities who are non-traditional feel included & thrive in technical careers)
  * How we define "non-traditional" (anyone who makes up a minority demographic in their job or computing classes, or anyone who didn't acquire a 4 year degree in computer science straight out of high school)

## Design Guidelines
   * Make our website accessible, follow [these rules] (https://uxdesign.cc/design-accessible-websites-6ebffcf583e2) and test for accessibility using browser extensions such as WAVE on Chrome
   * Ensure color contrasts are acceptable for low vision users (use browser extensions to verify)
   * Create a universal color scheme for us to use across all social media channels
   * Create an "issue" to share UI mockup with other devs & coordinate efforts
